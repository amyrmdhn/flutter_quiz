# Flutter Quiz App

This application is the result of learning to create applications using the Flutter Framework and getting used to working with Git and GitHub.

In the development of this application, the famous git branching approach created by Vincent Driessen was used. Even though it's quite embarrassing, I only implemented a small part of the overall strategy he created and this application is still very simple and still uses dummy data.

I created 2 branches, where the main branch serves as the branch for the stable application and the development branch is the branch where I do development.

At the end of the commit on the development branch, which I think the application is complete and stable, then I merge the development branch into the main branch with the command git merge --no-ffdevelop, to ensure the merge process runs smoothly. merge commit" to keep the branching history intact.
